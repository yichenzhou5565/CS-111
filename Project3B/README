Included Files:
README: What you are reading now
Makefile: three targets:
	  default: create a link to the executable
	  dist: make the tarball
	  clean: remove any files that are created during execution
lab3b.py: Python3 source file that do whatever specified
lab3b_shell: short shell script that runs lab3b.py

General design:
main()
	calls inodeConsistencyAudit():
	      get superblock info, freelist info, alloc info
	      print error message if any inaccordance is present
	      	    and set the global flag inconsistent=True
	calls blockConsistencyAudit:
	      checking while iteration goes on, print if
	      	       any disaccordance is present
		       and set inconsistent=True
        return 0 if no inconsistent found
	otherwise, return 2
	if any system call error, return 1

References:
To read the lines with ',' as deliminator, we used csv.reader().However,
there is a subtlety. csv.reader kind of serves as an iterator, so after
finishing the first loop, the iterator will be at the very last line of
the file and therefore the following loops will never get executed. This
problem is not that of a big deal when dealing with block reports, but
per the algorithm used for inode reports (first gather the ALL free list
and alloc list info and then decide if any invalid situations occur),
we searched and decide to use seek(0) to solve this problem:
