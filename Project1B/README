#include <sys/socket.h>
sockfd = socket(int socket_family, int socket_type
       int protocol);

memset VS. bzero:
http://c-unix-linux.blogspot.com/2009/01/bzero-and-memset.html
Generally speaking, using memset is more advisable when writing
a long program since it can be used in a wider range

void *memcpy(void *str1, const void* str2, size_t n);
copies n characters from memory area str2 to memory area str1

POLLHUP vs. POLLRDHUP
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56177060/pollhup-vs-pollrdhup
Distinction mainly in the background of socket. 
For POLLHUP, when polling a socket, will signal connection closed in
    both directions
For POLLRDHUP, connection may still be active in the not-shut-down
    direction.

#include <zlib.h>

https://www.zlib.net/manual.html
This version of the library supports only one compression method 
(deflation). Compression can be done in a single step if the 
buffers are large enough (for example if an input file is mmap'ed),
or can be done by repeated calls of the compression function.
* Initialization:
  The application must update next_in and avail_in when avail_in has 
dropped to zero. It must update next_out and avail_out when avail_out
has dropped to zero. The application must initialize zalloc, zfree and
opaque before calling the init function. All other fields are set by
the compression library and must not be updated by the application.
* opaque
  provided by the application will be passed as the first parameter 
for calls of zalloc and zfree. This can be useful for custom memory
management. The compression library attaches no meaning
to the opaque value.
* total_in & total_out
  The fields total_in and total_out can be used for statistics or progress 
reports. After compression, total_in holds the total size of the uncompressed
data and may be saved for use by the decompressor

gethostbyname("localhost");
https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-networking-3/
	gethostbyname-localhost-274323/
Equivalent as: 
	   gethostbyname("127.0.01");

Limitations:
I remember a piazza post for the previous project (i.e., 1A) saying that we
need not check for errors generated from write() system all. Therefore,
in the source code, I eliminated all error handling of write() system call
for better readablity and debugging purposes. Note that hence errors of write()
system call will not be directly handled this time.
