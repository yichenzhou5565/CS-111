**Important**
Here is a pitfall I dealt in the project. It is so tricky
that I spent like 2 days to figure it out. I record it for
my future references:

While reading the command, I first use fgets(). This is 
convenient and work just fine when testing through
keyboard and shell. But when it comes to pipe_test
in the sanity check, it will hang there forever.

The underlying reason, at least what I think, is that in
the pipe_test, all commands are thrown all at once. But
consider this man page:
https://linux.die.net/man/3/fgets

fgets() will end whenever there is an '\n' appears. This is
to say, in the pipe_test, it can only read the first command.
Therefore the "OFF" can never be reached, and the sanity
check just hang there forever.

A correct fix to this problem is use the read() system call
to read all things into a buffer and parse the commands,
if necessary, by using '\n' as separator. The lesson here,
I guess, is this is an OS class so that don't use those
fancy subroutine calls. Yes they are convenient and fast
but there are subtleties that I am not familar with and may
cost much more time to debug than to write the code itself.
