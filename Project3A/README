README: What you are reading now. Include ID info, general structure
	and references, etc.
Makefile: For compilation purposes
	  default:
		compile lab3a.c using gcc and relative flags
	  dist:
		make the tarball for submission and sanity check
	  clean:
		clean everything created during execution
lab3a.c: Source file. See "General Structure of Program" for details
ext2_fs.h: Header file specifying relative file system data structures

General Structure of Program (lab3a.c):
main()
	calls superblock(), which prints superblock summary
	calls group(), which prints group summary
	      calls freeblock(), which prints freeblock summary
	      calls free_inode()
	      	    if inode free, prints free inode summary
		    if inode alloc, calls inode()
		       if dirent, calls directory_entry()
		       if indirent, calls single/double/triple()

#include <unistd.h>
ssize_tpread(int fd, void* buf, size_t count, off_t offset);
pread() reads up to count bytes from file descriptor fd at offset
offset (from the start of the file) into the buffer starting at buf.
The file offset is not changed.
RC= # of bytes read: on success
RC=-1: set errno

To resolve .h file compilation probelms:
Order of inclusion does matter. Should include <stdint.h>.
