Included files:
REAME: What you are reading now
Makefile: for compilation
lab4c_tcp.c: source file for TCP connection
lab4c_tsl.c: source file for TLS connection. Here is a typo.
	     I really meant for the name to be tls, but it really
	     does not matter as long as I compile the executable
	     into the right name, so I did not bother to change it.

I referenced an example:

#include <openssl/ssl.h>
int SSL_read(SSL* ssl, void *buf, int num);
RC>0: successful
o.w.: not successful

#include <qsossl.h>
